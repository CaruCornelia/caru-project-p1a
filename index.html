Hello! I'm Caru, a digital artist who currently studies at
De La Salle University - College of Saint Benilde under the
Multimedia Arts course. I specialize in digital art and 
character illustration, but I've also picked up a good amount of
other skills too! This is my portfolio showing the projects that
I was able to accomplish both as an artist and as a student.</font></p>
